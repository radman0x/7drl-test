# Roguelike application skeleton

## First steps

Really just here to remind you friend ;)

## Basics

1. Clone this repository locally
1. Do an `npm install` in the root
1. Do a `git submodule update --remote libs` to get the latest version of the libs subrepo

## Github CI/CD and itch.io

1. Create a new repository on Github
1. Navigate to `Repo root > Settings > Secrets`
1. Create the secret `ITCHIO_BUTLER_TOKEN` and insert your butler token
1. Edit the `main.yml` in the root and replace the commented section
1. Set the remote for this repository to the one you've just created
1. Push your changes

*A build on Github should start automatically and push the result to itch.io!*
